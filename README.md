## Overview
The system predicts real estate prices based on features like location, area, and other parameters using machine learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Development
- **Pandas** - Data preprocessing
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning models

---

## Project Structure
- **Client**: Front-end (input and visualization)
- **Server**: Back-end for model serving
- **Model**: Contains training and evaluation code

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dunchutt/Real-Estate-Prediction.git
   cd Real-Estate-Prediction
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare real estate datasets.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models with Scikit-learn.
- **Prediction**:
Run the model scripts.
Provide input features for prediction.

**Results
