## Overview
The project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices. Preprocessing, model training, and evaluation workflows are implemented efficiently to analyze housing data.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** - Data preprocessing and machine learning models

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes real estate property details like:
- **Location**
- **Square footage**
- **Number of bedrooms/bathrooms**
- **Price**

You can place the dataset in the `data` folder.

---

## Model Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature scaling and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) are trained and tuned.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - RMSE, MAE, and R2 Score metrics are used for performance evaluation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dunchutt/Real-Estate-Prediction.git
   cd Real-Estate-Prediction
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the preprocessing and training script:
python train_model.py

Evaluate the model:
python evaluate_model.py

Make predictions:
python predict.py --input path/to/input.csv

## Results

The trained model achieves accurate predictions based on historical data. Metrics like R2 score and RMSE are visualized for evaluation.
